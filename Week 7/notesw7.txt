performance metric determines which protocol/solution better

brute force vs layering

brute force more effort, but faster
layering less effort per layer, reusable (change one layer without affecting others as long as same interface), less efficient

everything above transport layer is end to end
data link is hop by hop

only link layer needs header and footer for synchronisation

layered vs cross layer design

hub vs switch vs router
broadcast vs point to point vs different subnets(heirarchical ip address)

Cross-layer design refers to protocol design done by actively exploiting 
the dependence between protocol layers to obtain performance gains

vs layered design where protocols at different layers are designed independently, architecture
forbids direct communication between nonadjacent layers, communication between adjacent layers are also limited to 
procedure calls and responses

examples of cross layer design:
1.design an L3 protocol that needs L1 to pass a parameter to L3 at runtime which calls for a new interface
2.view L2 and L1 as a superlayer and design a joint protocol
3.design protocol at L3, keeping in mind process done in L1, non independent design

if many architecture violations accumulate over time, original architecture can completely lose its meaning
detrimental effect on system longetivity

wireless networks offer opportunistic communication that cannot be sufficiently exploited in layered design
e.g time varying link quality allows oportunistic use of channel
e.g wireless medium offers new modalities, physical layer receives multiple packets, broadcast nature of channel

proposals for implementing cross layer interactions:
1.direct communication between layers
2.shared database across all layers
3.new abstractions/design
