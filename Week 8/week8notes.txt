Internetworking is the practice of interconnecting multiple computer networks, such that any pair of hosts 
in the connected networks can exchange messages irrespective of their hardware-level networking technology. 
The resulting system of interconnected networks are called an internetwork, or simply an internet.

circuit switching - dedicated resources for guaranteed performance
		  - FDM, TDM
		  - better for constant bit rate data (e.g voice calls)

packet switching - statistical multiplexing
		 - better for bursty data
		 - more and more circuit like

X ~ B(35, 0.1)

P(X>10) = 1-binomcdf(35, 0.1, 10)

Homework

1. why do we have reliability at both layer 2 and layer 4?
2. why do we use both IP and MAC addresses in the Internet?
